# Recreation of Shazam 
## ECE 2200 Final Project
Michael Xiao and Jared Gallina

In this project, we recreated the popular music app, Shazam, which is able to recognize songs as you play them.  In the project, we used concepts from FFTs on MATLAB to execute this.  With an average recognition time of 5.14 seconds, our script was able to correctly identify songs from a library of 50 different tracks.
